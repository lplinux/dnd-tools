## [0.0.5] – 2026-05-07

### PC Sheet & Manage Campaign — Relationship labels, type editing, and connection editing

#### Backend (`app.js`)
- **New DB column** `status_label VARCHAR(100)` on `pc_relationships` (migration via `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`). Stores free-form status text; suggested values are *Alive* / *Dead* / *Deceased* but any string is accepted.
- **POST** `/api/pc/:playerId/relationships` now accepts and persists `status_label`.
- **New route** `PATCH /api/pc/:playerId/relationships/:relId` — updates `name`, `relation_type`, `status_label`, `link`, and/or `parent_id` on an existing relationship. True partial update (only fields present in the body are changed). Players cannot edit DM-created relationships (same protection as DELETE).
- **New route** `PATCH /api/campaigns/:campaignId/char-tree/connections/:connId` — updates `label` and/or `notes` on an existing DM cross-connection.

#### Manage Campaign (`manage-campaigns.html`)
- **Relationship pills** (Character Tree tab, per-player group) now show a `status_label` badge when present: 🟢 for *alive*, 💀 for *dead*/*deceased*, 🏷️ for any other label.
- **Canvas tooltips** for all relationship nodes (family tiers, sibling row, social fan) now include a `Status:` line when `status_label` is set.
- **Edit cross-connection**: each connection row now has a ✏️ button that re-opens the Add Connection modal pre-filled with the current label and notes. In edit mode the From/To selectors are hidden (entity endpoints are immutable after creation); only label and notes can be changed. Calls `PATCH` instead of `POST`.

#### PC Sheet (`pc-sheet.html`)
- **Add Relation modal**: new *Status* field — `<datalist>`-backed free-text input with preset options *Alive*, *Dead*, *Deceased*, *Missing*, *Unknown*. Wired to `status_label` in `submitRelation`.
- **Relationship list chips**: show the `status_label` badge inline (🟢 alive / 💀 dead or deceased / 🏷️ other).
- **Edit Relation**: ✏️ button added to every chip (hidden only for DM-created rels when the viewer is a player). Clicking it re-opens the modal pre-filled with all existing values and calls `PATCH` on save. The modal title and submit button label switch between *Add Relation* / *Add* and *✏️ Edit Relation* / *Save* depending on mode.

### Manage Campaign — Character Tree fixes & layout

- **DB fix**: `character_relationships` CHECK constraints only allowed `'player'` and `'npc'` entity types, but the app sends `'relationship'` for pc_relationship nodes. Added `ALTER TABLE … DROP CONSTRAINT … ADD CONSTRAINT` migration to include `'relationship'` in both `from_entity_type` and `to_entity_type` allowed values. Existing rows are unaffected.
- **NPC visibility**: NPC nodes are now only rendered on the canvas if they appear in at least one DM cross-connection. Disconnected NPCs are still available in the "Add Connection" dropdown but don't clutter the graph.
- **Tree-structured layout** (replaces radial layout):
  - Each player gets a horizontal band. Family relationships (Grandparent, Parent, Sibling, Child, Grandchild) are placed on vertical tiers above/below the player node, mirroring the pc-sheet hierarchy: Grandparent at −2 × tier-height, Parent at −1, Sibling at 0 (left/right alternating), Child at +1, Grandchild at +2.
  - Multiple nodes on the same tier are spread horizontally, centred on the player.
  - A horizontal dashed connector bar links siblings/cousins on the same tier; vertical spine lines run from player to tier midpoints.
  - Social/non-family relationships fan out to the right of the player node at a configurable arc angle (±55°).
  - NPC nodes (when connected) appear in a labelled row below all player bands, separated by a dashed "NPCs" divider.
  - Tier labels (Grandparent / Parent / Sibling / Child / Grandchild) render on the left edge at ≥0.5× zoom.
  - Relation-type labels render above each family node at ≥0.55× zoom.
  - Viewport auto-fits the bounding box of all nodes on first load.

### Journey Path Map — Distance Matrix Modal sticky header fix

- **Root cause fixed — `border-collapse: collapse` vs sticky**: `border-collapse: collapse` is fundamentally incompatible with `position: sticky` — collapsed borders are "owned" by adjacent cells and paint over sticky elements, causing scrolled cell content (e.g. `+ set` text) to bleed through the pinned row-header column. Switched to `border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 0` with one-sided per-cell borders, which is the only correct approach.
- **Corner cell truly frozen on both axes**: `thead th:first-child` now has explicit `position: sticky; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 3` so it remains anchored at the intersection of the frozen row and column during both vertical and horizontal scroll.
- **Clean separator line**: replaced `box-shadow + clip-path` workaround (which was itself a symptom of the `border-collapse` bug) with a simple `border-right: 2px solid var(--border2)` on sticky row-header cells.

### Manage Campaign — Character Tree improvements

- **Canvas size**: increased from 380 px to 600 px tall to show more of the graph without scrolling.
- **Zoom & pan**: scroll wheel zooms in/out centred on the cursor. Drag to pan anywhere on the canvas. Three zoom buttons (＋ / − / ⊡ reset) fixed to the top-right corner of the canvas.
- **Hover tooltips**: hovering any node on the canvas shows a dark tooltip with the full name, relation type, family flag, and owning player (where applicable). Tooltip follows the cursor and disappears when the mouse leaves a node.
- **No self-connections**: the "Add Connection" modal dynamically removes the selected "From" entity from the "To" dropdown, making it impossible to create a connection from an entity to itself.
- **Players as connection targets**: the connection modal now lists player character nodes (⚔️ `[Player]` prefix, `p_N` key) in addition to relationship nodes, so DMs can draw cross-connections directly to/from player characters.
- **NPCs as connection targets** (new): the connection modal now also lists all campaign NPCs (🎭 `[NPC]` prefix, `n_N` key). NPC nodes are rendered on the canvas below the player ring in a horizontal row, with a green (`#7ab050`) outline and a distinct fill. The connection legend shows the NPC colour swatch when NPCs are present.
- **Cross-connection rendering fix**: `drawTree` now correctly resolves `npc` entity type in cross-connections (key `n_<id>`), in addition to `player` (`p_<id>`) and `relationship` (`r_<id>`).
- **Backend**:
  - `GET /api/campaigns/:id/char-tree` now also returns `npcs` (all `campaign_npcs` for the campaign, ordered by name).
  - `POST /api/campaigns/:id/char-tree/connections` parser extended with `n_` prefix → `{ type: 'npc', id }`.


### Manage Campaign — Full Refactor

- **Tab-based layout**: campaign detail panel is now divided into six tabs — Players, Locations, NPCs, Timelines, Character Tree, and Settings — replacing the previous single-scroll layout.
- **Locations tab improvements**:
  - Added a live **search/filter** input to quickly find locations by name.
  - Fixed the Size/Type select: now uses `compact-type` CSS class — auto-width, no longer stretching the full row.
  - Location list is sorted **alphabetically** by name.
- **Settings tab**: contains the Calendar type display, Today Marker picker, and the Delete Campaign (danger zone) button. These controls were previously scattered in the main panel.
- **Character Tree tab** (new):
  - Pulls all `pc_relationships` entries from every player's PC Sheet in the campaign and displays them as collapsible per-player groups with family/non-family visual distinction.
  - Interactive **canvas graph** rendering player character nodes with their relationship satellites, connected by edges. DM cross-connections rendered as dashed red lines.
  - **DM-only cross-connections**: DMs can link any two relationship entries from any players (e.g. "Sister of Player1 is allied with Enemy of Player2"). These connections are stored in the new `character_relationships` table and are invisible to players.
  - Cross-connections list with labels, optional notes, and per-row delete.

### Journey Path Map — Fixes & New Features

- **Distance Matrix Modal**:
  - Locations row/column headers now **sticky** while scrolling (CSS `position: sticky` on `thead th` and `tbody th`).
  - Close button moved to a fixed **✕** in the top-right corner of the modal header; old footer Close button removed.
  - Matrix rows/columns now **sorted alphabetically** by location name.
- **Location list** in the sidebar is now sorted **alphabetically**.
- **Measure tool** (`📐`, keyboard `M`):
  - New in-memory (never saved) tool for measuring paths between pinned locations.
  - Click pinned locations sequentially to build a measurement chain. Shows total distance, per-mode travel times (walk/horse/fly), and per-segment breakdown for 3+ stops.
  - Missing distances flagged with a warning; partial known total shown.
  - Dashed green SVG overlay with numbered circles drawn on the map.
  - Clicking the last waypoint undoes it; switching tools or pressing a tool key clears the measure.
- **Smart distance sidebar** (when a location is selected):
  - Distances shown in the right panel are now filtered by size/type proximity rules:
    - **Huge/Big** cities: show all Huge/Big cities, Medium/Small within 150 mi, others within 50 mi.
    - **Medium/Small** cities: show Huge/Big within 150 mi, Medium/Small within 100 mi, others within 50 mi.
    - **Other** (village, inn, post, unset): show only the closest Huge/Big city, Medium/Small within 80 mi, others within 50 mi.
  - Hidden location count shown with a link to open the full distance matrix.
  - Each row shows the target location's size/type as a small badge.

### PC Sheet
- **DM-only relationships** — DMs can mark any relationship as *Hidden from player* (🔒) when adding it. Hidden relationships are stored with `is_dm_only = true` and are never returned by the API to player-role users. On the DM's view they appear with a dashed border and a 🔒 **DM only** badge. A **👁 Unhide / 🔒 Hide** toggle is available — but only on relationships the DM created.
- **DM-created relationships are protected** — relationships created by the DM (`created_by_role = 'dm'`) cannot be deleted by the player. The delete button is hidden client-side and the `DELETE` endpoint rejects the request server-side. The Hide/Unhide toggle only appears on DM-created entries.
- **Nested relationships** — any relationship can now be marked as a child of another (e.g. "Father's Mentor", "Mentor's Rival"). A *Child of* dropdown in the Add Relation modal lists all existing top-level relationships as candidates. Children render indented with a `↳` prefix beneath their parent in the list.
  - `app.js`: migrations add `created_by_role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'player'` and `parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES pc_relationships(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`; `POST` stores both; `DELETE` blocks players from removing DM-created rels; `PATCH .../visibility` rejects requests on player-created rels
  - `pc-sheet.html`: Add Relation modal gains a *Child of* selector; `openRelModal` populates it with top-level rels; `submitRelation` sends `parent_id`; `renderRelList` rewritten to nest children under parents and show/hide Delete and Hide buttons based on `created_by_role`

### Backend (`app.js`)

- `GET /api/journey-maps/:id/locations` now LEFT JOINs `campaign_locations` to include `size_type` on each placed location object.
- New DB table `character_relationships` for DM cross-player relationship connections (campaign-scoped, `from_entity_id`/`to_entity_id` reference `pc_relationships.id`).
- New API routes:
  - `GET /api/campaigns/:id/char-tree` — returns all players, their pc_relationships, and DM cross-connections for a campaign.
  - `POST /api/campaigns/:id/char-tree/connections` — creates a DM cross-connection.
  - `DELETE /api/campaigns/:id/char-tree/connections/:connId` — removes a DM cross-connection.

### Manage Campaign — Previous session (size/type on locations)

- `campaign_locations` table: added `size_type VARCHAR(50)` column (migration via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`).
- POST and PUT location API endpoints now accept and persist `size_type`.
- Add and Edit location forms both include the Size/Type dropdown.
- Location table displays a Size/Type column (alphabetically sorted).

## [0.0.4] – 2026-05-06

> PR #8 · Branch `lplinux/extend-journal-map`

### Journey Path Map
- Extended the Journey Map module with significant new functionality (exact
  features visible in `journey-map.html` and `journey-map-public.html` diffs).
- Added / improved the **public read-only view** (`journey-map-public.html`),
  allowing the map to be shared via token without authentication.

### General improvements across modules
- Small UX and correctness fixes applied to several HTML modules
  (`manage-campaigns.html`, `npc-sheet.html`, `pc-sheet.html`,
  `pc-public.html`, `timeline.html`).
- Minor backend fixes in `app.js` (bug-fixes logged under "A lot of
  improvements done").
- Added helper scripts `scripts/create-admin.js` and `scripts/setup-db.js`
  for easier first-run database and admin-account setup.
- Added a proper `.env.example` template documenting both the full
  `DATABASE_URL` connection string and the individual `DB_*` field options.
- Added a startup shell script `run.sh`.
- Updated `package.json` (dependency or script changes).
- Updated `ARCH.md` and all per-module `docs/*/README.md` files to reflect
  the current state of the application.
- `TODO.md` pruned and reorganised into clearly tracked open items.

## [0.0.3] – 2026-04-30

> PR #7 · Branch `lplinux/refactor-timeline-module`

### Timeline
- **Major refactor** of the Timeline module (`timeline.html`).
  - Data persistence migrated from browser `localStorage` to the PostgreSQL
    database; timeline data is now tied to a Campaign and a Player.
  - Added `init.sql` for initialising the timeline-related DB schema changes.
  - Backend routes for timeline CRUD updated in `app.js`.

### Other modules
- `header-component.js` updated (shared nav/auth header improvements).
- `index.html`, `item-cards.html`, `journey-map.html`,
  `journey-map-public.html`, `manage-campaigns.html`, `pc-public.html`,
  `pc-sheet.html`, `pdf-viewer.html`, `user-panel.html` — all received
  minor fixes and consistency improvements as part of the broad refactor
  pass.
- `TODO.md` cleaned up: completed items removed, remaining work reorganised.

  `manage-campaigns.html`, `npc-sheet.html`, `pc-public.html`, `pc-sheet.html`,
  `pdf-viewer.html`, `user-panel.html`.
- `header-component.js` updated to support the new shared nav design.

### Authentication & Permissions
- Permission/role changes introduced (`app.js` + `header-component.js`) as a
  follow-up to the auth system added before 0.0.1; minor access-control
  corrections applied across protected routes.

### Infrastructure
- `docker-compose.yml` updated.
- `package.json` updated (dependency alignment).
- `run.sh` helper script added.
- `package-lock.json` added to `.gitignore`.
- `TODO.md` expanded with detailed roadmap items (journey-map, timeline
  private mode, manage-campaigns integrations).
